# üëã Hi, I'm Brandon Leeker

A multidisciplinary professional with a unique background spanning **operations**, **technology**, **customer support**, and **risk management**.

I began my journey in operations, and quickly progressed into leadership roles, where I led initiatives bridging **strategy**, **compliance**, and **technical execution**. My passion for fraud, risk, and compliance intersected with my love for technology during the pandemic. While at **Square**, I helped maintain financial stability and mitigate fraud risks during a period of heightened uncertainty, all while upholding a strong customer focus.

As my career progressed, I made the decision to shift into **IT** to expand my technical skills and build a bridge between my operational background and growing interest in **cybersecurity** and **fraud prevention**. My goal is to leverage my existing strengths alongside a technical skill set to make a meaningful impact at the intersection of **technology**, **risk**, and **customer focus**.
