Hi, I'm Brandon Leeker, a multidisciplinary professional with a unique background that spans operations, technology, customer support, and risk management.

I began my journey in operations and quickly grew into leadership roles across customer support and risk, leading initiatives that bridged strategy, compliance, and technical execution. I found my passion for fraud, risk, compliance intersected with my love for technology during Covid where I helped Square maintain financial stability as fraud risk grew due to the pandemic all while upholding a strong customer focus. As I progressed, I made a decisio to shift into IT to expand my technical skills and build a bridge between my operational and managerial background and evolvoing interests in cybersecurity and fraud prevention. My goal s to leverage my existing strengths with a technical skillset to make a meaningful impact at the intersection of techonlogy, risk, and customer focus.
